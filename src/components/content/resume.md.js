I was an organizer for the HamOnt Conference series in Hamilton and topic leader for HamOnt UX. I've mentored for Ladies Learning Code in Hamilton and I have volunteered for local political issues like public transit and various elections.

Currently most of my spare time is been spent with my family. I also enjoy painting, design, strumming guitars, gardening and sailing when I can find the time.
